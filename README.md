Hide all (or some of them) your action bars easily. Enable CTRL/ALT/SHIFT modifiers to make them appear again (Default is only CTRL). 

Action bars reappear when your Spellbook is open. Optionally, when your Character or Talents panel is open.

Go to `Options > Addons tab > HideMyBars` to change the settings. These settings are saved per character.

This works very well in combinations with large WeakAura settings, which can act as a fully dynamic UI. (example: https://wago.io/LuxthosEvokerDragonflight)
